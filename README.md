# üìù Task Overview

This SQL project involves creating a table to store employee performance data and executing queries to analyze trends and patterns in their scores. It focuses on the use of Oracle SQL functions, conditions, and analytical queries to gain insights from data.

# üìÇ Table Used

EMPLOYEE_SCORES

This table stores performance data for each employee including:

EMP_ID (Employee ID - Primary Key)

NAME (Employee Name)

DEPARTMENT (Department Name)

SCORE (Performance Score)

REVIEW_DATE (Date of Review)

# üì• Sample Data

The table includes 15 rows of sample employee data across different departments like Sales, HR, IT, and Marketing with varying scores and review dates.

#üõ†Ô∏è SQL Concepts Used

CREATE TABLE ‚Äì To define the schema for employee performance data.

INSERT INTO ‚Äì To add multiple rows of data into the table.

SELECT ‚Äì To retrieve and view data.

WHERE ‚Äì To apply conditions and filter results.

GROUP BY ‚Äì To group data for aggregation.

ORDER BY ‚Äì To sort the results based on column values.

RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ...) ‚Äì A window function to rank employees within departments.

WITH Clause (CTE) ‚Äì Used for modular and readable subqueries.

# üìà Key Analytical Queries Performed

Ranking Employees by Score: Shows how each employee ranks within their department.

Above-Average Performers by Department: Lists employees whose scores are higher than their department‚Äôs average.

Top Scorers: Identifies the highest scorer(s) in each department.

Monthly Performance Trend: Shows how average scores vary by month.

Score Distribution: Provides a breakdown of scores per department.

# üìò Concepts Used

CREATE TABLE

Used to define a structured table (EMPLOYEE_SCORES) with appropriate data types such as NUMBER, VARCHAR2, and DATE.

INSERT INTO

Inserted individual records into the table to simulate real-world employee performance data.

SELECT

Used to retrieve specific columns or all data from the table.

WHERE Clause

Filtered data based on conditions like score greater than average or department-specific filtering.

GROUP BY

Aggregated data by department or time (month) to find trends and summaries like average scores.

ORDER BY

Sorted data in ascending or descending order for better analysis of patterns.

Window Functions (RANK() OVER)

Applied to rank employees within each department based on their score without grouping the data.

CTE (WITH Clause)

Used for cleaner and modular queries by defining temporary result sets for further use in the main query.

# üí° What I Learned

How to create and populate tables in Oracle SQL.

Writing analytical queries using RANK() and window functions.

Understanding how to filter and compare data using subqueries.

Applying GROUP BY with aggregation functions like AVG() to extract insights.

Using CTE (Common Table Expressions) to simplify complex queries.

Importance of date formatting (TO_DATE) when working with temporal data.

# üõ†Ô∏è Skills Practiced

Designing SQL tables for real-world scenarios.

Writing clean and meaningful SELECT queries.

Performing department-level and time-based performance analysis.

Using advanced SQL features to identify top performers, score trends, and above-average contributors.

Enhancing data interpretation using SQL joins and functions.


# ‚úÖ Outcome

This task helps visualize employee performance metrics, detect departmental trends, and identify top performers using advanced SQL queries in Oracle. It demonstrates effective use of SQL for real-time data analysis and reporting.
